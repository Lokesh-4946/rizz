# Orchestrator Build Plan

rizz is the local Project Intelligence Engine for any coding agent. The build plan should keep that
position sharp: understand the repo, expose evidence, review risk, and give other agents a compact
context contract.

ECC-inspired features are useful when they strengthen that contract without joining the default path.

## Human-Agent Loop

rizz is most useful when a human keeps their preferred coding agent and uses rizz as the local
evidence contract around that agent:

1. Human intent.
2. rizz mission contract, project intelligence, and inspect-first context.
3. Coding agent implementation.
4. rizz review.
5. rizz correction packet.
6. Coding agent repair.
7. rizz verification.
8. Human approval.

The product should optimize this loop without turning rizz into a heavy default orchestrator. rizz
must distinguish static understanding from runtime verification, recommend targeted checks, and only
upgrade confidence when evidence exists.

Current loop readiness:

| Stage | Readiness | Remaining | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Human intent | 75/100 | 25 | Intent can enter through CLI/review/explain flows, but mission-contract capture is still lightweight. |
| rizz mission contract, project intelligence, and inspect-first context | 88/100 | 12 | Project intelligence, Mission Control, confidence queues, security/tool inventory, and UAT artifacts are strong; mission-contract packaging can be sharper. |
| Coding agent implementation | 70/100 | 30 | rizz can inform any agent, but session adapters and repair handoff formats remain opt-in/future work. |
| rizz review | 91/100 | 9 | Review Intelligence has blast-radius evidence, affected flows/tests/configs, and deterministic review artifacts. |
| rizz correction packet | 80/100 | 20 | Component-local architecture correction packets now exist; broader review/evidence correction packets still need unification. |
| Coding agent repair | 72/100 | 28 | Repair instructions are inspectable, but agent-specific apply/repair loops are not yet first-class. |
| rizz verification | 84/100 | 16 | Verification evidence and runtime-honesty rules exist; targeted proof loops need stronger UX and scoring. |
| Human approval | 70/100 | 30 | Reports support approval, but explicit approval packets and signoff state are still thin. |

## Opt-In Expansion Map

| Feature | rizz Usefulness | Default Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session adapters / control-pane snapshot | Import work history and agent state as inspectable evidence. | Opt-in export/import, not always-on orchestration. |
| MCP/tool inventory | Record available tools and risk posture for repo intelligence and review. | Opt-in scan artifact. |
| Worktree lifecycle service | Run isolated experiments and PR loops from a clean branch. | Opt-in workspace mode. |
| Manifest install/state ownership | Install and repair rizz packs without guessing what is owned. | Opt-in pack command. |
| Security scanner | Add secret/risky-pattern evidence to reviews and confidence gates. | Local deterministic scan, no cloud call. |
| Deterministic harness audit | Score whether a repo is ready for agent work. | Local report under `.rizz/research/`. |

## Current Loop

1. Calibrate Architecture Reasoning so capped large-repo UAT scores service-to-flow causality,
   impact maps, cross-component relationship evidence, what-breaks claims, and confidence debt
   separately.
2. Scorecard reporting after each UAT run: planned score, actual repo capability score, and
   remaining distance to 100.
3. Use bounded UAT on complex repos such as `github/docs` and `vercel/next.js` to choose the next
   weakest capability instead of guessing.
4. Full local gate: `pnpm check`, `pnpm pack:check`, `git diff --check`.

The current slice sharpens Architecture Reasoning correction packets for component-local gaps. rizz
now writes `component_correction_packets` into `architecture_reasoning.json` and feeds those packets
into `confidence_debt.inspection_queue`, so agents see precise read/inspect/test/verify steps before
generic architecture debt. The 120-file large-repo UAT matrix stayed at Architecture Reasoning
84/100, but the remaining debt is more actionable: `github/docs component:config` gets a priority-1
packet for missing config/test/entrypoint/flow evidence, and `vercel/next.js component:scripts` gets
a priority-1 packet for missing component-local test evidence without claiming runtime verification.
The next weakest repo-derived area remains Architecture Reasoning, specifically moving correction
packets from component-local architecture gaps into broader review/evidence repair handoffs.

## Capability Scorecard

These are the orchestrator baseline scores for planned work. UAT reports also include actual
repo-derived scores from `.rizz/research/understanding_score.json`.

| Planned item | Baseline | Remaining | Next improvement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Flow Understanding | 86/100 | 14 | Deepen route, service, and journey reconstruction. |
| Architecture Reasoning | 87/100 | 13 | Calibrate confidence and what-breaks claims. |
| Evidence Quality scoring | 88/100 | 12 | Make weak, stale, and low-confidence evidence easier to inspect. |
| Mission Control UX | 88/100 | 12 | Expose score, queue, and drilldown movement in the portal. |
| PI-Bench seed/task format | 86/100 | 14 | Broaden deterministic task coverage and UAT fixtures. |
| Incremental Understanding metrics | 88/100 | 12 | Improve repeated-scan reuse and stale-surface explanations. |
| Review Intelligence with true blast radius | 88/100 | 12 | Tie changed files to user-visible failures with stronger causality. |
| `rizz ask` | 0/100 | 100 | Keep gated until foundation scores justify broad answers. |

Repo detail:

| Repo | Architecture score | Remaining | Local evidence gap flows | Static runtime verification flows | Weakest capability |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `github/docs` | 79/100 | 21 | 0 | 113 | Architecture Reasoning, 79/100 |
| `vercel/next.js` | 89/100 | 11 | 0 | 101 | Incremental Understanding metrics, 88/100 |

Precision notes:

- `github/docs` no longer reports `113 flow(s) need local evidence`; it reports 113 weak flows as
  static runtime-verification debt with 0 local-evidence gap flows. `component:src` is verified from
  15 direct entrypoints, 44 local tests, 8 local configs, and 8 read-first files; `component:config`
  remains inferred with 8 read-first files and now gets a priority-1 correction packet for missing
  component-local config/test/entrypoint/flow evidence.
- `vercel/next.js` no longer reports `101 flow(s) need local evidence`; it reports 101 weak flows as
  static runtime-verification debt with 0 local-evidence gap flows. `component:scripts` is verified
  from 52 direct entrypoints, 2 local configs, and 8 read-first files, while now getting a priority-1
  correction packet for 0 local tests; `component:test` is verified from 3 direct entrypoints, 32
  local tests, 4 local configs, and 8 read-first files.
- Runtime verification remains explicit in `flow_evidence_precision`; local static evidence does not
  upgrade script-derived flows to verified architecture confidence, and correction packets do not
  claim repairs were performed.
