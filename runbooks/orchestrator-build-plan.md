# Orchestrator Build Plan

rizz is the local Project Intelligence Engine for any coding agent. The build plan should keep that
position sharp: understand the repo, expose evidence, review risk, and give other agents a compact
context contract.

ECC-inspired features are useful when they strengthen that contract without joining the default path.

## Opt-In Expansion Map

| Feature | rizz Usefulness | Default Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session adapters / control-pane snapshot | Import work history and agent state as inspectable evidence. | Opt-in export/import, not always-on orchestration. |
| MCP/tool inventory | Record available tools and risk posture for repo intelligence and review. | Opt-in scan artifact. |
| Worktree lifecycle service | Run isolated experiments and PR loops from a clean branch. | Opt-in workspace mode. |
| Manifest install/state ownership | Install and repair rizz packs without guessing what is owned. | Opt-in pack command. |
| Security scanner | Add secret/risky-pattern evidence to reviews and confidence gates. | Local deterministic scan, no cloud call. |
| Deterministic harness audit | Score whether a repo is ready for agent work. | Local report under `.rizz/research/`. |

## Current Loop

1. Evidence Quality + Architecture confidence calibration.
2. Mission Control inspectability for low-confidence, weak-evidence, and stale claims.
3. PI-Bench assertions for the new inspection contract.
4. Full local gate: `pnpm check`, `pnpm pack:check`, `git diff --check`.

The current slice is the Confidence Inspection Queue: one deterministic list that tells a human or
agent what to inspect first before trusting broad repo understanding.
